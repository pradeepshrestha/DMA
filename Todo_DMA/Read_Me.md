Todo List is almost similar to a reminder app. This app basically helps to set the reminder for the user. 
The major features of the app are :-


1) The auto rotation has been taken in consideration. You can simply rotate the app and the screen rotation 
does not effect the app. (Rotation Problem Fixed)


2) The app has been error free and robust implementation. I have implemented multiple provided use cases 
with dynamically built views using fragments.


3) Swipe delete feature has been added to the app in any screen rotation.


4) You can also delete all the reminders using side navigation pane.


5) You can set up as much reminders as you can. Using this app you can also set different priority level for the 
reminders using priority level 1 to 10. The reminders then arranges as per the priority level set by the user in 
ascending order. This is the additional feature of the app.


6) You can also download the TodoList in your phone storage (Inside Documents) using Download button in 
the form of text file.
